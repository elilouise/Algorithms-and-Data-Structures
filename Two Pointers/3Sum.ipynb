    "# Approach: Sort nums array and scan through it in search of triplets that sum up to target value (target value = zero in this case)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Sort the nums array, through the use a for loop and a while loop, find the three numbers that add up to zero, all while making sure we're avoid duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Steps\n",
    "1. Sort nums array\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use a for loop to scan and look at the first triplet number in nums\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check that we're not looking at duplicate triplet combinations that starts with the first number (`if index > 0 and nums[index] = nums[index -1]`)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If the first element repeats (there is duplicates) then skip to next number `continue` \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use a while loop find the other two numbers that when added with the first number sum up to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If nums[index] + nums[left] + nums[right] == 0, then add the triplet combination of numbers (Add and store it in an array) to the triplets output array. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Increment left pointer \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Continuously check if current element is a duplicate of the former element and also ensure left pointer doesn't go out of bounds when it gets incremented: `while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left] - 1:`\n",
    "\n",
    "9. If current element is a duplicate then increment left pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Check if nums[index] + nums[left] + nums[right] > 0, if yes then decrement right\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Check if nums[index] + nums[left] + nums[right] < 0, if yes then increment right\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Output triplets array\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this problem proved challenging. The challenging part was ensuring we dont add in duplicate sets of triplets in our output array. I think this was the only challenging part come to think of. Writing the correct code that correctly implemented the checks proved to be difficult for me. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another point of interest about this problem is the fact that we need to comsider three sets of numbers at a time. To do this algorithmically we simplified the approach by first looking at the first element (via a for loop) and then looked at the other two elements (via a while loop).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now for the dreaded part - IMPLEMENTING THE DUPLICATE CHECKS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting the array enables us to implement this check very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since all duplicates will be located in adjacence to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start the INITIAL Duplicate check from the second element. \n",
    "\n",
    "EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE DO THIS:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**When you iterate through the nums array, you're using the current index to check for possible triplet combinations that sum up to zero. As you iterate, you're essentially saying, \"Let's take this number at the current index as the first number of the triplet and find the other two numbers that, combined with this number, sum up to zero.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now, when you're at the first index (index 0), there's no previous number to compare with, so you cannot have a duplicate triplet that starts with this number (since it's the very first number you're considering).**\n",
    "\n",
    "**However, from the second element (index 1) onwards, there's a possibility that this number is the same as the previous number. If you've already considered a number as the first number of a triplet and have found all the triplets that include it, then considering it again would result in duplicate triplets.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**For example, consider the array $[-1, -1, 0, 1, 2]$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When you're at index 0, you'll consider -1 as the first number of the triplet and then look for two other numbers that sum up to 1 (since -1 + 1 = 0). In this case, those numbers are 0 and 1.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now, when you move to index 1, you see -1 again. If you consider it once more as the first number of a triplet, you'd end up finding the same numbers 0 and 1 again, leading to the same triplet $[-1, 0, 1]$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**To avoid this redundancy, you skip the current number if it's the same as the previous number, which is why you start the \"INITIAL Duplicate check\" from the second element.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Initial duplicate check in first element position.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first element is repeated in nums then skip current index and move on to the next. \n",
    "\n",
    "`if nums[index] == nums[index -1]:`\n",
    "\n",
    "`continue`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have to check for duplicates in the two other numbers that make up our triplet.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we do this? Using our two pointer algo with an addition ofcourse!\n",
    "\n",
    "`while left < right:` \n",
    "\n",
    "we are going to perform the check under the part where we find the triplet combination of numbers that add up to zero, because this is where we will have potential duplicates being added to our output / result array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we find a correct triplet for the first time, we will proceed to adding it into our output / result array and then we will increment the left pointer (works perfectly fine if we choose to decrement right instead of increment left also). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the left pointer is now pointing to its successive neighbour (i.e left pointer now at the next adjacent element).\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to check if the current element (the adjacent element) is a duplicate of its predecessor.\n",
    "\n",
    "If it is we need to increment left yet again (inorder to skip to the next element). In case next element might be also be a duplicate we need to make sure we are continuously performing this check until we reach a distinct and new element. \n",
    "\n",
    "How? By using a while loop. Oh we also need to ensure left pointer doesnt go out of bounds also.\n",
    "\n",
