    "## Approach Overview: \n",
    "\n",
    "Through the use of the sliding window technique (two pointers: one fast and one slow) we shall visit every character in string s and construct & keep track of the length of a **valid substring**. A substring is **valid** if the number of characters we can replace inorder to make it a substring that only contains **one type of repeating character** is less than or equal to k. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time we encounter a new character that can't be added to the substring such that the substring will still be a  valid substring, we will continuously reduce the size of our substring by decrementing the count of the leftmost character in current substring and increment the left pointer. Decrementing the count of the leftmost character and incrementing the left pointer means that we are looking for the next possible valid susbtring in s. We are trying to find out where the next immediate valid substring is in s. And we try to do that by moving the left pointer to the next leftmost character / i.e it's adjacent, neighbour character and see if this character make for a valid substring (remember a valid substring is a valid if: the number of characters we can replace inorder to make it a substring of purely repeating characters is less than or equal to k). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initializing our critical pointers (that will keep track of start & end point of substring) and initilize maxlength a variable that will store the length of the longest substring we encounter in s**\n",
    "\n",
    "  `left = 0` \n",
    "  \n",
    "  `maxlength = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Initializing a hashmap to store the count of every character in current susbtring**\n",
    "\n",
    "  `characterCount = {}`\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Loop through every character in string s, btw the loop counter is going to act as the right pointer**\n",
    "\n",
    "  `for right in range(len(s)):`\n",
    "  \n",
    "**4. Calculate the count of current character in current substring on store it in our characterCount hashmap**\n",
    "\n",
    "  `characterCount[s[right]] = characterCount.get( s[right] , 0) + 1`\n",
    "  \n",
    "**5. Check whether current substring we're looking at is not valid (number of characters we can replace to make it a substring filled with only repeating characters is greater than k)** \n",
    "\n",
    "   Our condition for **substring validity** expressed in mathematical form: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   `if (length of current substring) - (the count of the most frequent character in current susbtring) <= k` then substring is valid\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `if (length of current substring) - (the count of the most frequent character in current susbtring) > k` then susbtring is NOT VALID\n",
    "   \n",
    "**6. Okay let's now first check if current substring is NOT VALID, repeat this until we finally find a substring that's VALID**\n",
    "\n",
    "   `while (right - left + 1) - max( characterCount.values() ) > k:`\n",
    "   \n",
    "**7. Move and consider the next leftmost charater. In this step what we are doing is finding where the next immediate susbtring is**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   *decrement the count of leftmost character*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `characterCount[ s[left] ] = characterCount.get(s[left]) - 1`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   *increment left pointer*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `left += 1`\n",
    "   \n",
    "**8. Calculate the length of current susbtring and update maxlength (length of longest substring seen so far) if length of current susbtring is bigger than the one we've previously seen**\n",
    "  \n",
    "  `maxlength = max(maxlength, right - left + 1)`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. After everything is all visited, calculated, compared to, and done. *Queue drum rolls* we now return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter**\n",
    "\n",
    "  `return maxlength`"
