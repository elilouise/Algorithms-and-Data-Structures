    "## Approach Overview: \n",
    "\n",
    "Loop through the character positions in `s`, retrieve the current 10-letter-long substring (sequence) and add it to a set keeping store of all visited susbtrings (sequences). \n",
    "\n",
    "If the substring (sequence) is already in the `seenSequences` set, then add it to another set keeping store of all the repeated susbtring in s (we called it `outputSequences`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initializing the set that will store all visited / seen substrings in s\n",
    "\n",
    "   `seenSequences = set()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initializing the set that will store all repeated / duplicate substrings in s\n",
    "\n",
    "   `outputSequences = set()`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Loop through the character positions in s (from first character position to 9th before last position) inorder to retrieve and process all 10-letter-long substrings in s without going out of bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "   `for left in range(len(s) - 9):`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Retrieve the current 10-letter-long substring from the current character position\n",
    "\n",
    "   `currentSequence = s[left: left + 10]`\n",
    "   \n",
    "  \n",
    "5. Check if current substring (sequence) is not in 'seenSequences' set\n",
    "\n",
    "   `if currentSequence not in seenSequences:`\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "6. If it's not in 'seenSequences' set then add it\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `seenSequences.add(currentSequence)`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "7. Check if substring (sequence) is already in 'seenSequences' set\n",
    "\n",
    "   `else:`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If it is, then this means the substring is a duplicate, so add the substring to the output set\n",
    "\n",
    "   `outputSequences.add(currentSequence)`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "9. Finally, convert the output set to a list and return the results\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   `return list(outputSequences)    `"
