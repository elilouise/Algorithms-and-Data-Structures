    "## Approach Overview: Use Sliding window (a slow and fast pointer approach) to calculate maximum profit\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflections:\n",
    "\n",
    "This was a good problem to deal with. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Problem decription</b>: <i>Given an array filled with prices of a stock on the *<b>ith</b>* day. We want to figure out whats the maximum profit we can make within this time frame. We want to know what's the lowest price we can buy a stock for and what's the highest we can sell that stock for!</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, buy **LOW**, sell **HIGH**, baby. \n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this we used a two pointer approach, but instead of initializing the pointers at opposite ends of the input array, we initialize the left one at start, 0th index (0th day), and the right one at the 1st index (1st day).\n",
    "\n",
    "I initially got stuck with this problem because I was incorrectly incrementing the right pointer, I was either incrementing it too early and as a result skipping over important array elements or incrementing it one too many times, which again resulted in skipping over important stock prices. Missing out on finding the lowest possible buy price and maximum possible profit. Other than that I managed to do the rest of the code well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually just because of this mistake the right pointer problem was also often times going out of bounds and the compiler was giving OUB error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Come to think of it this was the biggest pitfall of this problem. To avoid skipping and missing out on stock prices and as a result calculating the wrong maximum possible profit, how does this happen, by prematurely incrementing the right (sell) pointer. We must increment it after we firstly **finish calculating the current profit** and secondly **checking whether current sell price (right pointer) is lower than current buy price (left pointer)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize left (buy), right (sell) pointer and maxprofit\n",
    "\n",
    "`left, right = 0, 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "`maxprofit = 0` (lowest possible profit we can return)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. repeat until right pointer reaches end of stock prices array:  `while right < len(prices):`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculate the current profit: `currentprofit = prices[right] - prices[left]`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Check whether value of current profit is bigger than maximum profit computed & stored so far: `maxprofit = max(currentprofit, maxprofit)`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After we finish with step 4 we will check if the current sell price (right pointer) is smaller than current buy price (left pointer). Remember we want to buy at the lowest possible price, so for each iteration we need to always check if the current sell price is potentially lower than the current value we have stored for the buy price \n",
    "\n",
    "  `if prices[right] < prices[left]:`\n",
    "\n",
    "If sell price is lower than buy price, move the left pointer (buy) to the right pointer position (sell), such that the stock price located at the right pointer becomes the new buy price \n",
    "     \n",
    "  `left = right`\n",
    "  \n",
    "6. look at stock price for the next day (i.e increment right). This is done outside the if statement block btw!\n",
    "\n",
    "  `right += 1`"
