    "Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string `\"\"`.\n",

    "## Approach Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterate through the characters in `s` until we find a valid substring window. \n",
    "\n",
    "A window is valid if every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find a valid window, then we start shrinking the window (to search for an even shorter valid window) by removing the leftmost character until the window becomes invalid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once window is invalid, we resume the expansion of the window by iterating through the remaining characters in `s`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This was my first LeetCode hard. Unfortunately, I couldn't solve it on my own, I had to lookup a neetcode video solution :(\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea is quite simple though, but the implementation was a little tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the idea is to expand a substring window (in the `s` string) until we find a valid window. BTW, a substring window is valid if all the characters in `t` and it's count are present in the current window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we find a valid window, we continuously shrink its size by removing the leftmost character in it until it becomes invalid. \n",
    "\n",
    "We do that to find the <b>smallest possible valid substring</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "So as long as the window stays valid (all the characters in `t` and its corresponding counts are still present in the current window) during the process of us removing characters from it (shrinking the window), then we know are on the right track to finding the smallest possible valid susbtring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once it becomes invalid we then keep iterating through the remaining characters in `s` and expanding the window until we find another valid window. Once we do we repeat the shrinking process again and then the expansion until we reach the end of `s`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I was a bit on the right track to solving this problem. I had a hunch that I needed a variable to keep track of character matches in s susbtring window and t. But didn't spot the pattern of expanding the substring window until we find a possible solution. I was very fixated on getting the minimum substring just on the first go. I was being a perfectionist and it was holding me back. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note to self: Use the dataset I'm given (and don't be afraid to make up my own example dataset if I want to) and dry run it. Iterate through each character and try to spot the pattern. Ask myself questions like under what condition will i pause the expansion of this window? And under what condition will i shrink the window? "
