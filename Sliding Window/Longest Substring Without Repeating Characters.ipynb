    "## Approach Overview: \n",
    "\n",
    "Loop through every character in string and each time we encounter a new character, we add it to a hashset of substring and then compute its length. Each time we encounter a duplicate character (i.e. a character that's previosuly been added in substring hashset), we start removing characters from the substring hashset until we reach where the duplicate character is and finally remove it. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involves us increasing the size of the sliding window each time we encounter a new character and we decrease the size of the sliding window each time we encounter a duplicate, we keep decreasing it until the duplicate is finally removed. What's interesting is that we don't make the mistake of directly removing the character from the hashset in one go. No, no, no. See we perform this operation in a very smart way. Such that we don't lose track of the longest possible non-repeating substring, we start removing characters starting with the leftmost character in the original string then move to the next one and the next one until we reach the position for where the duplciate character is in string. This ensures that the left pointer always points to the very start of a non-repeating substring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "say `s = \"abseopsrtakox\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "After first complete substring pass: `substring = \"abseop\"` , `length of substring = 6`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we reach the `'s'` at index `position 6`, we will realize that `'s'` is already in hashset. So we can't add it in yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do now is starting remove characters from the hashset starting from the very first character we added (i.e. first character in string s) and second added character and so on, until we reach the duplicate character (in this case `'s'`). This method ensures we are correctly calculating the longest consecutive non-repeating substring. I mean say we just removed 's' directly and updated the the left pointer to `position 6` and start counting a new consecutive substring from there, this would be incorrect. Because clearly the next consecutive substring in s starts from `index position 3` (where character `'e'` is) : `\" e o p s\"` and not at `position 6`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our algo knows this and ensures it never loses track of the next consecutive non repeating substring in s. \n",
    "\n",
    "next consecutive non repeating substring is now : `\"eopsrtakox\"` (which is actually the longest one with at length of 10!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Very sharp algo! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. As always we start by initializing critical variables that will help us to do our dirty effective work (*inserts evil laugh*).**\n",
    "\n",
    "These include a right pointer, left pointer, a hashset to store unique characters and maxlength (to store length of longest possible non-repeating substring)\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize both left and right to 0 (such that it points at the index of the very first char in string s)\n",
    "\n",
    "  `left, right = 0, 0` \n",
    "  \n",
    "  `substring = set()`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  `maxlength = 0`\n",
    "  \n",
    "**2. Now we shall being traversing through each char in string s (in search of the longest possible non repeating substring)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this we need to loop through every character in s, let's use a while loop to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "we shall continue to loop until the right pointer is no longer smaller than the length of the string s (until right pointer exceeds the length of string s).\n",
    "\n",
    "   `while right < len(s):`\n",
    "   \n",
    "**3. Next we shall check if current character s[right] is NOT in susbtring hashset**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   `if s[right] not in substring:`\n",
    "    \n",
    "**4. If current character is not in the substring hashset then add it in there, then calculate the length of length of current substring and THEN increment right**\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   *add the current character to substring hashset*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `susbtring.add( s[right] )`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   *calculate the length of current substring and check if its larger than longest one we've seen so far*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `maxlength = max(maxlength, (right - left) + 1 )`\n",
    "   \n",
    "   *move to next consecutive character in string s*\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `right += 1`\n",
    "     \n",
    "**5. Else if character is in susbtring hashset (current character is a duplicate), then being truncating (removing from) the hashset, starting with the leftmost character (until we reach and remove the duplicate character).**\n",
    "    \n",
    "   *if character is in susbtring hashset*\n",
    "    \n",
    "   `else:`\n",
    "    \n",
    "   *remove leftmost character in string s from the substring s*\n",
    "    \n",
    "   `substring.remove(s[left])`\n",
    "    \n",
    "   *move left pointer to next leftmost character in string s / increment left pointer*\n",
    "    \n",
    "   `left += 1`\n",
