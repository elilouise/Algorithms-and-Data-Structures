    "## 1. Hash Map for Object Copying\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 138. Copy List with Random Pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Uses a hash map to maintain one-to-one mapping between original nodes and their deep copies\n",
    "- Allows reconstruction of complex pointer relationships (e.g., next, random, or child pointers)\n",
    "- Typically involves a two-pass traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Deep copying graphs\n",
    "- Linked lists with random pointers\n",
    "- Tree-like structures with parent or sibling pointers\n",
    "- Handling cyclic or shared references\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Two-Pointer Traversal for Merging Sorted Lists\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Uses two pointers to traverse two sorted lists simultaneously\n",
    "- Compares elements at each step and merges them into a single sorted output\n",
    "- Typically achieves linear time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Merging sorted data structures (linked lists, arrays)\n",
    "- Interval merging\n",
    "- Finding intersections\n",
    "- Comparing two ordered sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Two-Pointer Technique for Removing Nth Node from End\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Uses two pointers to traverse the linked list\n",
    "- Second pointer starts after the first pointer has moved n steps ahead\n",
    "- Allows for identifying and removing the nth node from the end in one pass\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Locating and manipulating specific nodes based on their relative positions from the tail\n",
    "- Maintaining linear time complexity and constant space\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. In-Place Reversal Using Iteration and Pointers\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 206. Reverse Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Iteratively reverses a linked list by reassigning each node's next pointer to its previous node\n",
    "- Reverses the direction of the list in one pass\n",
    "- Achieves O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Reversing linked lists or segments of them\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Digit Extraction and Reconstruction for Linked List Addition\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 2. Add Two Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Scans through each node of two linked lists to extract their digits\n",
    "- Stores digits in reverse order\n",
    "- Performs arithmetic addition\n",
    "- Reconstructs the resulting sum as a new linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Arithmetic operations on lists or sequences representing numbers\n",
    "- Handling carryovers or digit-by-digit summation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Cycle Detection in Array-as-LinkedList\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 287. Find the Duplicate Number\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualizes the array as a linked list where array values act as pointers\n",
    "- Uses fast and slow pointers to detect a cycle in the linked list representation\n",
    "- Applies Floyd's cycle detection algorithm to find the entry point of the cycle\n",
    "- Identifies the duplicate number as the node where the cycle begins\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Finding a duplicate in an array with values in range [1, n] and length n+1\n",
    "- Detecting cycles in array-based structures without modifying the input\n",
    "- Solving problems requiring O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity"
