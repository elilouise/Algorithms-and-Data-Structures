    "\n",
    "## 1. Hash Map for Object Copying\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 138. Copy List with Random Pointer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Uses a hash map to maintain one-to-one mapping between original nodes and their deep copies\n",
    "- Allows reconstruction of complex pointer relationships (e.g., next, random, or child pointers)\n",
    "- Typically involves a two-pass traversal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Deep copying graphs\n",
    "- Linked lists with random pointers\n",
    "- Tree-like structures with parent or sibling pointers\n",
    "- Handling cyclic or shared references\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Two-Pointer Traversal for Merging Sorted Lists\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Uses two pointers to traverse two sorted lists simultaneously\n",
    "- Compares elements at each step and merges them into a single sorted output\n",
    "- Typically achieves linear time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Merging sorted data structures (linked lists, arrays)\n",
    "- Interval merging\n",
    "- Finding intersections\n",
    "- Comparing two ordered sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Two-Pointer Technique for Removing Nth Node from End\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Uses two pointers to traverse the linked list\n",
    "- Second pointer starts after the first pointer has moved n steps ahead\n",
    "- Allows for identifying and removing the nth node from the end in one pass\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Locating and manipulating specific nodes based on their relative positions from the tail\n",
    "- Maintaining linear time complexity and constant space\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. In-Place Reversal Using Iteration and Pointers\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 206. Reverse Linked List\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Iteratively reverses a linked list by reassigning each node's next pointer to its previous node\n",
    "- Reverses the direction of the list in one pass\n",
    "- Achieves O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Reversing linked lists or segments of them\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Digit Extraction and Reconstruction for Linked List Addition\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 2. Add Two Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Scans through each node of two linked lists to extract their digits\n",
    "- Stores digits in reverse order\n",
    "- Performs arithmetic addition\n",
    "- Reconstructs the resulting sum as a new linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Arithmetic operations on lists or sequences representing numbers\n",
    "- Handling carryovers or digit-by-digit summation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Cycle Detection in Array-as-LinkedList\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 287. Find the Duplicate Number\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visualizes the array as a linked list where array values act as pointers\n",
    "- Uses fast and slow pointers to detect a cycle in the linked list representation\n",
    "- Applies Floyd's cycle detection algorithm to find the entry point of the cycle\n",
    "- Identifies the duplicate number as the node where the cycle begins\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Finding a duplicate in an array with values in range [1, n] and length n+1\n",
    "- Detecting cycles in array-based structures without modifying the input\n",
    "- Solving problems requiring O(1) space complexity and O(n) time complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Doubly Linked List with Hash Map for LRU Cache\n",
    "**Problem Example:** 146. LRU Cache\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Description:**\n",
    "- Combines a **doubly linked list** with a **hash map** to efficiently implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache.\n",
    "- The **hash map** allows for O(1) access to key-value pairs.\n",
    "- The **doubly linked list** maintains the order of usage, with the **most recently used** item at the head and the **least recently used** at the tail.\n",
    "- When a new item is accessed or added, it is moved to the front (head) of the list. If the cache exceeds capacity, the item at the tail (least recently used) is evicted.\n",
    "- Both `get` and `put` operations are handled in O(1) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ideal for:**\n",
    "- Problems that require efficient cache eviction policies.\n",
    "- Maintaining fast access to recently used items while also keeping track of less frequently used items.\n",
    "- Implementing data structures that require both fast lookups and efficient reordering of elements."
