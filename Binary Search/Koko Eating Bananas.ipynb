    "Koko loves to eat bananas. There are `n` piles of bananas, the `ith` pile has `piles[i]` bananas. The guards have gone and will come back in `h` hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eats `k` bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than `k` bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.\n",

    "## Approach Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Test if koko can eat bananas in time against a range of 'eating speed' solution set. We perform binary search on the solution set (koko's eating speed) inorder to lookup and test potentially valid 'eating speed' solutions more efficiently (faster).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay there's very little chance I'd be able to come up with a solution for this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key trick involved realizing that there's a fixed range of 'eating speed' solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The valid minimum eating speed is 1 and the maximum valid eating speed is the maximum number of banana pile. So eating speed can be anywhere from 1 to the maximum amount in banana pile (max(piles)). \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the key insight of this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then take and test whether the eating speed is fast enough for koko to eat all the banana piles in time (before the guard comes back). \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the eating speed is too slow (too small) (i.e. eating time is larger than h), then we discard the current eating speed and its predessecors (smaller / slower eating speeds from the solution set), and consider only the next largest (faster) eating speed from the solution set. \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the eating speed is fast enough (eating time is less than or equal to h), then we save that value, and consider an even smaller valid eating speed until we find the most minimum valid eating speed from the solution set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then return that most minimum valid eating time :)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I failed to realize the key insight of this problem: there's a solution range (eating speeds). \n",
    "\n",
    "How did I fail to realize it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because I didn't inspect the input dataset hard enough and I didn't ask the right questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions like, given this input dataset, what's the maximum valid eating speed? (an eating speed is valid if it allows koko to eat all the banana piles before the guard comes back). Or what's the minimum valid eating speed?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) I failed to come up with a clever way to calculate the number of hours it'll take koko to eat a banana pile (algorithmically), (HINT: It was basic physics, time = number of bananas / eating speed). \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: math.ceil(piles[i]/k) \n",
    "\n",
    "3. I was also too afraid come up with a rough less time efficient solution. I was too caught up with wanting to get it right the first time. And as a result was stuck and got nowhere."
