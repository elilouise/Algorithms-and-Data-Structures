    "# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array\n",

    "Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:\n",

    "## Approach Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "We perform binary search on nums array to look for the smallest element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each time calculating the location of the middle element, checking it against the rightmost element and then narrowing down the search window accordingly based on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the middle element is smaller than rightmost element in window, then we narrow search window (to look for smaller values) by decrementing rightmost pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the middle element is larger than rightmost element in window, then we (again) narrow search window (to look for smaller values) by incrementing leftmost pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh boy, I struggled a lot with this one. \n",
    "\n",
    "So this is a classic binary search problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're given a sorted array that's rotated a bunch of times. Because of this, the array will get grouped into two sections, one on the left and one on the right. The CRUCIAL insight is to realize the group of sorted elements on the right is always going to be SMALLER than the left ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is only after realizing this that we can come up with search conditions to find the smallest value.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's the search condition you ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "It's actually simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "We just compare the middle element with either the leftmost or rightmost element and then narrow search window based on the result. I chose the rightmost element because the solution becomes shorter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, each time we compute the middle element we're trying to find out which group of sorted values it belongs to. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is it part of the left group? (i.e. the larger sorted values), if yes, then we definitely need to ignore the values to the left of it and narrow the search window to look for smaller ones (located to the right of it / current middle value). \n",
    "\n",
    "Or is it part of the right group? (i.e the smaller sorted values), if yes, then we ignore all the values to the right of it and narrow the search window to try and find even smaller ones (located to the left of the current middle value).\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the middle element with the rightmost element is a strategic choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "It simplifies the decision-making process regarding which half of the array to search next.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I didn't inspect the input dataset (nums array) carefully enough to realize the critical insight: The array is sectioned of into two groups of numbers. One on the left hand side (that's larger) and one group on the right hand side (that's smaller). \n",
    "\n",
    "2) I struggled to figure the search condition pattern because I didn't think logically enough about the dataset (e.g. I didn't ask myself basic questions like what if I computed the midpoint location and what if that value was smaller / larger than the leftmost value or rightmost value?). \n",
