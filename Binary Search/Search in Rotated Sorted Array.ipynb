    "# 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array\n",

    "There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (`0-indexed`). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.\n",

    "Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or `-1` if it is not in nums.\n",

    "## Approach Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Search through nums array for the exact location of target. In each iteration we narrow down search window based on location of target value. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay so the idea is simple, but the implementation was hard because it was difficult to figure out all the search cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do I mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a classic binary search. We're constantly trying to figure out which portion of the array to ignore and which to narrow our search window to. The difficult part was figuring out the criteria to use to narrow the search range. \n",
    "\n",
    "This array is also a rotated array, which means it's split into two sorted parts. One on the left (bigger in size) and one on the right (smaller in size). \n",
    "\n",
    "How did we figure out the search criteria? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well we used the mid-point, the rightmost, and leftmost element to figure out our current position in the array and the position of the target value itself. Then we narrowed down search window based on those.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, there were only four possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Midpoint is in left section and target is in right section\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Midpoint is in left section and target is in left section\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Midpoint is in right section and target is in right section\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Midpoint is in right section and target is in left section\n",
    "\n",
    "- If (1) is the case, then we need to move search window to the right section \n",
    "\n",
    "- If (2) is the case, then we need to move search window to the left section\n",
    "\n",
    "- If (3) is the case, then we need to move search window to the right section\n",
    "\n",
    "- If (4) is the case, then we need to move search window to the left section\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Key Note</b>: We're using Midpoint to find target location, each time we compute midpoint, the first thing we check is whether it's now at target location. If not, then we use the pointers (right, left and mid) to firstly find out where target is located, and then we narrow the search window to that location. Rinse and repeat :)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Figuring out all the search case, I managed to come up with only two cases, 1) if midpoint was located in left section and target in right section and 2) if midpoint was located in right section and target was in left section. I was not able to clearly visualize all the possible cases and what to do in each of them. It was simply painful. Maybe if I had drew it down I would have. Maybe! \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Implementing the damn search conditions algorithmically. Honestly dont think i would have been able to figure out the implementation without seeing the damn solution. Sad face :(\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Figuring out all the search cases and what to do in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Figuring out all the search cases and what to do in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Figuring out all the search cases and what to do in each case. Now that I'm thinking about it, I think the reason is because I also wasn't focused and logical enough."
