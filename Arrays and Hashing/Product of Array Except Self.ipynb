    "\n",
    "Overview: Calculating the prefix and postfix arrays. Then calculate final product output array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem has caused me alot of intellectual and emotional misery. I spent 5 days going through it and the solutions over and over again and not get anywhere, until I went through neetcode video explanation once more and then it finally clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without any further ado, here's a detailed solution explanation of this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off deeply understanding the problem, we are given an array filled with integer values and are told to compute and return the product of each element in the array except the current array element. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example if the nums array equals to [ 1 , 2 , 3  , 4 ]. What we to return is the following, output = [ product of all 'nums' element except element at 0th index | product of all 'nums' element except element at 1st index | product of all 'nums' element except element at 2nd index | product of all 'nums' element except element at 3rd index ] = [ 24 = 2 * 3 * 4, 12 = 1 * 3 * 4 , 8 = 1 * 2 * 4 , 6 = 1 * 2 * 3 ].\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: \n",
    "\n",
    "The solution for this leverages a technique called post and prefix. \n",
    "\n",
    "I first heard neetcode on youtube imply this was the technique behind it. What this essentially means is that for each element we are going to calculate its pre and post-fix values and multiply them together (result = prefix * postfix). \n",
    "\n",
    "Ok great but what the hell is a prefix and postfix I hear you ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well prefix is just the product of all the numbers situated on the left hand side (pre / before - indexes) of the current integer value and postfix is the product of the numbers situated on the right hand side (post / after - indexes) of the current integer value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "\n",
    "         (prefix)  ,  (current element) ,  (postfix)\n",
    "     \n",
    "nums =   $[  ______ 1    , ________       > 2 <       ,    ___________  3  ,   ________4   ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the current element is 2 and the prefix value (product of all elements before it) is 1\n",
    "and postfix (product of all elements after it) is 3*4 = 12.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the special case where we consider the very first element in the nums array we will set the prefix value to 1 and for the special case of the very last element in the nums array we will set postfix value to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to solve this we will do a pass to build up a prefix array. Then do a pass to build up a postfix array. Then do a pass to multiply respective array elements of both arrays together and store it in a final output array. Then finally return the final output array.\n"

    "#### Challenges: Note down any aspects of the problem that were particularly challenging and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges I faced include struggling to effectively calculate the prefix and postfix results. And subsequently computing the final output results. It wasnt sure at which index position i should begin my loop passes to calculate the prefix and postfix results. I was trying to rush the solution by attempting to do everything in one go, thinking about how i would be able to calculate everything in one pass, only to end up frustrated and stuck. In my reflections I somehow forgot that the result of the output is a simple product of the prefix[i] and postfix[i] results. I didnt have clarity over how to effectively transverse the nums array inorder to compute the prefix and postfix results, more so the postfix (because you have to go in reverse order to calculate it AND THEN reverse the postfix array only that the end to obtain the respective postfix value of each element (in the right order). \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically i didnt effectively break down the problem and lacked clarity and understanding in how to correctly build the arrays. I think it didnt even occur to me that i would probably need more than one for loop to achieve my outcomes. I just remember feeling overwhelm and lost for most of this problem. How do I caclulate postfix? Where do I store it? If I use an array to store it, in which position should i start looping? What is the pattern required to compute postfix values algorithmally? Wait how can I do both prefix and postfix at the same time? I can't see the pattern to calculate prefix and postfix? \n",

    "\n",

It helped me to find the pattern in how i would calculate the respective prefix and postfix results and sometimes realize the video solutions I was looking at on youtube (cough cough neetcode) were suboptimal and unecessarily complex. Also write it in your own words. Use an example and try to spot the solution pattern (i.e the pseudocode / the steps requirewd to get the correct answer). This was invaluable, if i didnt do that I'm not sure i would have been able to spot the pattern on how to calculate the postfix and prefix results algorithmally.\n",

    "And to calculate and build up postfix of each element in the array, you must perform another (second) pass (but this time in reverse order / from finish to start).\n",
