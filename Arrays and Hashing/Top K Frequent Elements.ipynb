    "This problem involves us going through an array filled with integers and outputing the top k integers that occurs the most (is most frequent). This will involve us counting the frquency of each element and storing them and then figuring out a method for us to identify the top k most frequent elements and outputting it algorithmically.\n",

The index of the array / list represents the frequency of elements, and their corresponding elements, the elements are grouped and stored together at the specified index position using an array.\n",
